# Password-Strength-Analyzer-


## Objective:
This project aims to evaluate the strength of a password using regular expressions (regex) to enforce specific security rules and provide recommendations for improvement. Unlike many typical password strength analyzers that rely on predefined libraries or heuristic algorithms, this tool leverages regex to directly validate password elements like length, character types, and patterns. By focusing on regex, it offers a lightweight and customizable approach to password validation, encouraging users to create stronger, more secure passwords.

## Features:
- **Password Validation**: Analyzes the input password based on predefined security rules.
- **Strength Score**: Provides a numerical score indicating the password's strength.
- **Recommendations**: Gives suggestions to improve weak passwords.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant evaluation of password strength as the user types.
- **Regex-Based Validation**: Uses custom regular expressions to check for the presence of required password components, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Customizable Rules**: Unlike typical analyzers, which might use a fixed set of rules, this tool can be easily modified with new regex patterns for personalized validation.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python** (for backend validation if creating a script)
- **JavaScript** (for frontend validation in a web app)
- **Regex** (for pattern matching and validation checks)

## How It Works:
1. **Length Check**: Passwords must have a minimum length of 8 characters.
2. **Character Variety**: Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
3. **Strength Calculation**: The strength is evaluated based on the presence of different character types, length, and common patterns.
4. **Suggestions**: The app will suggest ways to improve the password if it is weak (e.g., adding a special character or increasing length).

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have **Python** or **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- For the web version, use a browser and ensure JavaScript is enabled.

### Python Setup (for script-based version):
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-analyzer.git
   cd password-strength-analyzer
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python packages (if any):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the password strength analyzer script:
   ```
   python password_analyzer.py
   ```

### JavaScript Setup (for web app version):
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-analyzer.git
   cd password-strength-analyzer
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the password strength analyzer.

## Usage:
- Input a password into the field.
- The app will display the strength of the password and offer suggestions for improvement.
- The password is analyzed based on length, character variety, and common patterns.
  
## Example:

### Input:
```
Password123!
```

### Output:
- **Strength Score**: 80%
- **Suggestions**:
  - Your password is fairly strong but could be improved by making it longer or avoiding common phrases.
